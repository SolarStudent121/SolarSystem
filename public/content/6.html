        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than
        two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, while being slightly less than
        one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the
        Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient
        Roman religion.

        Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, followed by helium which constitutes a quarter of its mass and a tenth of its
        volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun. Because
        of its rapid rotation at a rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours, the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid, having a slight
        but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with
        turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant
        storm which has been observed since at least 1831.

        Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere. The planet's magnetic tail is
        nearly 800 million kilometres (5.3 astronomical units; 500 million miles) long. Jupiter has 92 known moons and likely
        many more, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
        Ganymede is the largest out of the four, being larger than the planet Mercury, followed by Callisto with Io and Europa
        being approximately the size of Earth's moon.

        Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet in December 1973.
        Jupiter has since been explored by multiple robotic spacecraft, beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions
        from 1973 to 1979, and later with the Galileo orbiter in 1995. In 2007, New Horizons visited Jupiter for a gravity
        assist to increase its speed, bending its trajectory on the way to Pluto. The latest probe to visit Jupiter, Juno,
        entered its orbit in July 2016. Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include its moon Europa, which
        likely has an ice-covered liquid ocean which scientists think could sustain life.
