        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is named after Greek sky deity Uranus (Caelus), who in Greek mythology is
        the father of Cronus (Saturn), a grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and great-grandfather of Ares (Mars). Uranus has the
        third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. The planet is similar in
        composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from those of the other two giant planets,
        Jupiter and Saturn (the gas giants). For this reason, scientists often distinguish Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants".

        As with gas giants, ice giants lack a well-defined solid surface. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and
        Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and
        methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with
        a minimum temperature of 49 kelvins (-224 °C; -371 °F). It has a complex, layered cloud structure; water is thought to
        make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer. The planet's interior is mainly composed of ices and
        rock.

        Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a
        unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit.
        Therefore, its north and south poles lie where most other planets have their equators. In 1986, images from Voyager
        2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with the
        other giant planets. No other spacecraft have yet visited the planet. Observations from Earth have shown
        seasonal change and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250
        metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph)
